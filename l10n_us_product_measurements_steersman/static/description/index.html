            <p class="text-justify">Our module adds length, width and height fields to products. The dimensions can be
                entered for both product templates and variants.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Our module adds an option to select UoM when entering product weight, volume and dimensions giving you
                the flexibility to use metric or
                imperial units as most practical for your business.

            <p class="text-justify">
                The measurements entered are converted into default Odoo metric units and stored in the native
                fields, which means that our module preserves the native Odoo data structure and is fully compatible
                with any other modules that may use information from the native fields. In addition, this means that you
                will not lose the entered weight and volume information if you upgrade the database to a newer version of
                Odoo or decide to uninstall the module.
